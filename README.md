## The rules
* You have one week to complete the task at your own pace

* Please avoid a single commit at the end, we are also interested in the commit history :)

* The visualization above is just a suggestion, it's up to you to implement it according to your imagination

* Try to work through the tasks in their order and refine the final result with each new requirement

* You can use libraries, but maybe we ask why exactly this one

* Provide your code as a runnable application in the repository

* Typescript is mandatory

_Hint: You will find the products in the data folder_

## The task

_Try to imagine a wild product owner approaching you and wanting to improve the shopping experience for our customers. The following requirements are specified_


* As a customer I want to be able to select products from the drop down list.

* As a customer I would like to be able to see the prices in the drop down list.

* As a customer I would like to be able to determine the quantity of the product before I add it to the shopping cart.

* As a customer I would like to be informed when I exceed the maximum number of products and be prevented from entering more than this number

* As a customer I would like to see the total for the selected product before I add it to the shopping cart

* As a customer I want to be able to see all my products in the shopping cart

* As a customer I want to be able to see the total of the shopping cart at any time

* As a customer I want to be able to remove products from the shopping cart

* As a customer I would like to be able to delete the entire shopping cart at once

* It's not allowed to have more than 10 products to the cart

* It is not allowed to add a quantity of items to the shopping cart that exceeds the "maxAmount" of the respective product

* The customer must be informed in an appropriate manner when one of the limits has been reached

* As a customer I want to see a graphical overlay when I confirm the purchase to know that my order was successful

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


## Extended scope

* As a customer I want to be able to select the quantity of products with a slider

* As a customer I want to be able to see the quantity selected with the slider also in the input field

* As a customer I want to see the new total for the selected quantity only after a few milliseconds
